5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
In the command, three things were combined: first, ../ which means the parent directory of my current working directory; the * is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters, so temp-* means all files whose names start with temp-; and . means the current directory where I am presently. Having explained the meaning of each, the command cp ../temp-* . stands for “copy all files in the parent directory (../) whose names start with temp- into the current directory (.).”

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
We didn’t have to do git init because the current directory was a result of the clone and was already a Git repository. It already contained a hidden .git/ folder.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
To commit the files I copied, I will do the following:
git add .      (to stage the new files)  
git commit -m "Add copied files"   (to commit the staged files)
